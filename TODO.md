Independent:
- Take assignment as a separate syntactic construct after the parser
- Commandline Options
- Write README
- Generated tests for errors
- Optional semicolons
- Remove Unit expressions at some point after the type checker
- More LLVM annotations
- Syntactic sugar
- Split pure and non-pure expressions
- Uniform Access principle
- Verifier tests
- Better error messages for precondition failures
- Suggestions for verifier errors
- Consistency checks for assumptions/proof obligations
- Use monad classes everywhere

- Function symbols without index
- Use symbols and not names in code generator
- Use more RecordWildCards
- Use better type classes for metadata
- Sort imports
- qualify imports
- Information hiding for metadata
- Check that vardefs are not used as expressions.
- Optional types for expressions
- Make variable symbol only dependent on scopes.
- Check that vals are not reassigned
- Generate names with $ uniformly
- Type safety for names
- Intermediate language for verification
